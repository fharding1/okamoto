# Okamoto

Okamoto is a library for producing NIZK proofs of knowledge of any linear relationship about discrete logarithms of ristretto255 group elements. That is, for a fixed n by m matrix M of group elements, we consider the language of tuples (x,H) where x is an m-dimensional vector of scalars and H is a n-dimensional vector of group elements such that Mx=H.
